## üè• Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying individuals into age groups using health-related data. By leveraging machine learning and exploratory data analysis, we aim to predict age categories accurately based on health indicators, lifestyle factors, and biometric measurements.

## üéØ Objective
- Preprocess and clean health datasets for analysis.  
- Explore and visualize key patterns and correlations in the data.  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to classify individuals into age groups.  
- Identify the most important features influencing age classification.  

## üìä Dataset
The dataset includes multiple health-related features:  
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender  
- **Vital statistics:** BMI, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate  
- **Lifestyle factors:** Physical Activity, Diet  
- **Other health indicators:** Glucose levels, Insulin, Cholesterol, etc.  

**Target Variable:** Age Group (e.g., Adult, Senior)

## üõ† Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and feature importance.  
3. **Model Building:** Implemented classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
4. **Evaluation:** Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  

## üíª Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost  

## ‚ú® Key Outcomes
- Cleaned and preprocessed health datasets for analysis.  
- Detailed exploratory analysis highlighting age-specific health trends.  
- Accurate classification of individuals into age groups using machine learning.  
- Identification of the most influential health features affecting age classification.
